<h2>About me</h2>

<p> I am a 17 year old who has been interested in how things work
   since the beginning. Following that trend, taking apart calculators
   and what not wasn't enough. I needed something more to know and learn about. Then I found computer coding and was
   immediately hooked at the problem solving and making things that I
   know exactly how it works</p>



<h2> Background </h2>

<p> I first started with good old HTML but soon realized that although a good
  structure there can be so much more depth with other languages. From there I
  was also introduced to the Galvanized community by an uncle. With my new found knowledge
   of where and how to take this interest of mine, I quickly signed up for the JavaScript workshop
   taught by Caleb Atwood and Jenny Allar. I learned tons about what coding could become and became a
   little involved in the Galvanized community. </p>
